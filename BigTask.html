<center> <h1> Introduction </h1> <center>
There are numerous issues facing our environment, such as pollution and resource depletion, do serious harm to both the natural world and humankind.  We must act to stop more harm and discover long-term fixes.  However, how? <p>

<p>
Hi there!  We are Group 5, Future Keepers committed to protecting ecosystems and people from damaging environmental effects.  We are dedicated to fighting climate change and advancing a better planet via the use of scientific and mathematical solutions.

 One of the greatest dangers facing our planet now is climate change.  Since we are not only impacted by these changes but also have the ability to alter them, it is imperative that we comprehend their impacts.

Come along with us as we explore and take action in the pursuit of a sustainable future!

<center> <h1> What is climate change? 
</h1> <center>
Climate change refers to significant, long-term changes in the global climate, particularly in the Earth's temperature and weather patterns. It is primarily driven by human activities, such  <b> burning fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, and industrial processes </b>, which release <b> greenhouse gases </b> like carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) into the atmosphere. hese gases trap heat from the sun, leading to a gradual warming of the planet, a phenomenon known as <b> global warming</b>. As temperatures rise, climate change causes disruptions in ecosystems, more frequent and intense natural disasters, rising sea levels, and shifts in weather patterns , threatening both human and wildlife survival. Addressing climate change requires global cooperation to reduce emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and adopt sustainable practices that protect the environment for future generations.<p> <b> Green House Gases: </p> </b> Concentrations of the key greenhouse gases have all increased since the Industrial Revolution due to human activities. <b> Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide </b> concentrations are now more abundant in the earth’s atmosphere than any time in the <i> last 800,000 years</i>. 8,9 These greenhouse gas emissions have increased the <i> greenhouse effect and caused the earth’s surface temperature to rise</i>. Burning fossil fuels changes the climate more than any other human activity.<p>

<p> <b> Carbon dioxide</b>: In recent years, human activities have released around <b> 35 billion</b> tons of <b> carbon dioxide</b> into the atmosphere <i> every year </i>. <b> 10 Atmospheric carbon dioxide</b> concentrations have increased by more than <b> <i> 40 percent </i> </b> since pre-industrial times, from approximately <b> <i>280 parts per million</i> </b> (PPM) in the <b>18th century 11 to 419 ppm in 2023.12.</b>
<p>
<b> Methane</b>: Human activities increased methane concentrations during most of the <b> 20th century </b> to more than <b>2.5 times</b> the pre-industrial level, from approximately <b> 722 parts per billion</b> (PPB) in the <b> <i> 18th century</i> </b> <b>13 to 1,922 ppb in 2023.14.</b>
<p>
<b> Nitrous oxide</b>: Nitrous oxide concentrations have risen approximately <b> <i> 20 percent</i> </b> since the start of the <b> Industrial Revolution</b>, with a relatively rapid increase toward the end of the <b> <i> 20th century</i> </b>. <b> Nitrous oxide</b> concentrations have increased from a pre-industrial <b> level of 270 ppb15 to 337 ppb in 2023.16.</b>

 <center> <h1> What are the causes and effects of climate change? </h1>

 <p>
<b><h2>Here are the reasons for Climate Change: Causes</b></h2>
<b>1. Fossil Fuel Combustion:</b> Burning of coal, oil, and natural gas to generate energy releases substantial quantities of CO2 and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, leading to climate change.
<p>
<b>2. Cutting Down of Forests:</b> Plants, such as trees, take in CO2, and when forests are cleared for land use or other purposes, stored carbon in vegetation is released to the atmosphere, fueling climate change.
<p>
<b>3. Industrial Processes:</b> Production processes such as cement and chemical industries emit greenhouse gases such as CO2, methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) that trap heat in the atmosphere.
<p>
<b>4. Agriculture:</b> Activities in agriculture, particularly livestock rearing, release methane and nitrous oxide. Fertilizers also release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.
<p>
<b>5. Waste Management:</b> Rotting organic waste in landfills releases methane, a very powerful greenhouse gas. Inefficient waste management contributes to this problem.
<p>
<b><h2>Effects of Climate Change:</h2></b>
<p>
<b>1. Rising Global Temperatures:</b> Perhaps the most apparent consequence of climate change is the incremental rise in global temperatures, resulting in more frequent and severe heatwaves.
<p>
<b>2. Melting of Ice Caps and Glaciers:</b> Increased temperatures lead to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, leading to increasing sea levels and habitat loss for animals such as polar bears.
<p>
<b>3. Extreme Weather Events:</b> Climate change is associated with an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including hurricanes, droughts, floods, and wildfires.
<p>
<b>4. Ocean Acidification:</b> Rising levels of CO2 also contribute to elevated carbonic acid in oceans, harming marine organisms, especially coral reefs and shellfish.
<p>
<b>5. Displacement of Populations:</b> Increased sea levels, climatic extremes, and scarcity of resources displace human populations, primarily from coastal and low-lying areas. It may cause climate refugees and further exacerbate geopolitical tensions.
<p>
<center> <h1>TRIGONOMETRY IN CLIMATE CHANGE?</h1> <center>
<p>
<h2>We can apply the trigonometry in climate change in various ways, such as:</h2>

1.Measuring the height of icebergs and glaciers
<p>
2. Rising of Sea Levels
<p>
3. Determining Temperature Fluctuations
<p>
A Scientist Measures the Melting Glacier
Dr. Reyes, a climate scientist, is studying a <u>glacier's melting rate.</u> From a <b>point 500 meters</b> away, he measures the <u>angle of elevation to the glacier's peak as 25°.</u> A year later, he returns and finds the angle of elevation has decreased to <u><b>20°.</u></b> By how much has the glacier’s height decreased?
<p>
<b>Given:</b> 
<p>
Distance from glacier:<u>500 meters</u> 
<p>
Before melting angle: <u>25°</u>
<p>
After melting angle: <u>20°</u>
<p>
<b>Solution:</b>
<p>
<b><i>tanθ= opposite/adjacent</i></b>
<p>
<b>Step 1:</b> <u>Calculate height before melting</u>
<p>
h1= 500 x tan(25°)
=500×0.4663= <u>233.15m</u>
<p>
<b>Step 2:</b> <u>Calculate height after melting</u>
<p>
h2=500 x tan(20°)
 =500 x 0.3640 = <u>182.00m</u>
<p>
<b>Step 3:</b> <u>Calculate height decrease</u>
<p>
h1-h2=233.15−182.00 = <u>51.15m</u>
<p>
Therefore, the glacier's height has decreased by <u><b>233.15m</u></b>
<p>
<center><h1>Solutions for Climate Change:</center></h1>
<p>
1. Sustainable Agriculture and Diet Changes
Agriculture contributes significantly to <u><b>greenhouse gas emissions</b></u>. Shifting towards <b>sustainable farming practices, reducing food waste, and encouraging plant-based diets can lower emissions</b>. Practices like <b>regenerative farming, organic agriculture, and reducing synthetic fertilizers</b> also help.
<p>
2. <b>Improving Public Transportation and Electric Vehicles</b>
Reducing reliance on <b>fossil fuel-powered cars</b> by investing in <b>electric vehicles (EVs), bicycles, and efficient public transport</b> systems can cut emissions. Expanding <b>clean-energy-powered buses, trains, and metro systems</b> can provide <b><u>greener transportation options.</u></b>
<p>
3. <b>Transition to Renewable Energy</b>
<u>Replacing</u> <b>fossil fuels with renewable sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power</b> reduces <u><b>greenhouse gas emissions.</u></b>
Governments can invest in <u>clean energy infrastructure,</u> while businesses and individuals can adopt <b>solar panels and energy-efficient technologies.</b>
<p>
4. <b>Reforestation and Forest Conservation</b>
Forests absorb <u>carbon dioxide,</u> helping to <u>balance atmospheric carbon levels.</u>
<b>Large-scale tree-planting projects, protecting existing forests, and promoting sustainable agriculture</b> can help mitigate climate change.
